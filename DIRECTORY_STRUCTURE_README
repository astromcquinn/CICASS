This is the CICASS IC generator code.  

The subdirectory makeCosICs/ contains the primary README file and the
IC generating code.  

The subdirectory vbc_transfer/ contains the code
that outputs the transfer function in the format that is required by
the makeCosICs code.  In the case with a velocity difference between
the baryons and dark matter, it generates a transfer function that has
a net relative velocity.

The subdirectory glass/ stores a glass file that has been evolved for
10^4 in scale factor as suggested in Crocce et al (2006) to minimize transients.
